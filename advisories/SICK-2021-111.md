### CVE ID
CVE-2021-39246

### CVSS Score
Pending

### Internal ID
SICK-2021-111

# Vendor
Tor 

### Product
Tor Browser on Windows, macOS, Linux

### Product Versions
10.5.6 and 11.x through 11.0a4

### Vulnerability Details

Tor Browser through 10.5.6 and 11.x through 11.0a4 allows a correlation attack that can compromise the privacy of visits to v2 onion addresses. Exact timestamps of these onion-service visits are logged locally, and an attacker might be able to compare them to timestamp data collected by the destination server (or collected by a rogue site within the Tor network). This occurs by default, with or without verbose.

### Vendor Response
Open pull request in relation to timestamp logging as v2 will be deprecated soon:

[https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/merge_requests/434](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/merge_requests/434).

### Proof of Concept

`Tor Browser` latest `10.5.6` is affected.

`Tor Browser` alpha `11.0a4` is affected.

This is because `Tor 0.4.6` introduced a warning every time a client connects to a v2 domain.

See: [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/commit/5e836eb80c31b97f87b152351b6a7a932aeffaed](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/commit/5e836eb80c31b97f87b152351b6a7a932aeffaed)

```bash

cd /tmp

wget https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/10.5.6/tor-browser-linux64-10.5.6_en-US.tar.xz

tar -xzvf tor-browser-linux64-10.5.6_en-US.tar.xz

cd /tmp/tor-browser_en-US/

./start-tor-browser.desktop --verbose

# Launching './Browser/start-tor-browser --detach --verbose'...

```

Visit any v2 onion site, connection timestamps are logged at the exact moment the server responds.
