### Title
private-ip npm package - Incorrect Regular Expression - Insufficient RegEx in private-ip npm package v1.0.5 and below insufficiently filters reserved IP ranges resulting in indeterminate SSRF.

### CVE ID
CVE-2020-28360

### CVSS Score
9.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID
SICK-2020-022
        
### Vendor
private-ip Project
        
### Product
private-ip

### Product Versions:
1.0.5 and below

### Vulnerability Details

Insufficient RegEx in private-ip npm package v1.0.5 and below insufficiently filters reserved IP ranges resulting in indeterminate SSRF. An attacker can perform a large range of requests to ARIN reserved IP ranges, resulting in an indeterminable number of critical attack vectors for server-side projects using private-ip 1.0.5 and below.

The private-ip npm package is a popular server-side package which fails to filter ARIN reserved IP ranges, allowing remote attackers to request server-side resources or potentially execute arbitrary code through various SSRF techniques.

The package is a security package used to attempt to prevent remote requests from reaching internal resources. Implemented RegEx in the v1.0.5 and below insufficiently account for a wide range of variations of localhost, private IP ranges, and IP ranges that are otherwise reserved by ARIN.

### Vendor Response
Patched in version 2.0.0

## Vulnerable Dependencies

- 12,120 direct weekly downloads of private-ip

- 355 publicly identified npm dependents of private-ip v1.0.5; packages that rely on private-ip.
-- https://github.com/sickcodes/security/raw/master/etc/CVE-2020-28360-private-ip-dependents.txt

- 73 GitHub projects that depend on private-ip https://github.com/frenchbread/private-ip/network/dependents

- 153,374 combined weekly downloads of all dependents, with the largest being libp2p related.

## PoC - Using patched private-ip 2.0.0 on tests from 1.0.5

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frenchbread/private-ip.git
cd private-ip
# git checkout master
git checkout 1.0.5 -- ./test.js
npm run test
```

Running patched private-ip 2.0.0 code against private-ip 1.0.5 test IPs:

- 17 passed
- 2 failed

The test ARIN reserved (private) IPs that failed are:
- 255.38.207.121
- 250.29.143.180

This indicates that since August 3rd 2016, 2 of the original test IP addresses have actually been reserved addresses.

## PoC - Using unpatched private-ip 1.0.5 on new tests from 2.0.0

The new test includes the minimum and maximum of every ipv4 range that is ARIN reserved.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frenchbread/private-ip.git
cd private-ip
git checkout -f master
git checkout 1.0.5 -- ./src/index.js
npm run test
```
Using the 1.0.5 RegEx with 2.0.0 [test.js](https://github.com/sickcodes/private-ip/blob/master/test.js)

Running private-ip 1.0.5 code against the minimum and maximum of private IP ranges in 2.0.0 test.js:

- 37 passed
- 71 failed

This indicates that since August 3rd 2016, a large number of reserved IP ranges have been considered public IP addresses.

An application that relies on private-ip 1.0.5 and below to verify whether an incoming request is to localhost, or a private resource, may perform a request to an local IP address, or an IP address that is reserved, potentially resulting in an SSRF.

Since since August 3rd 2016 the following IP's, and all of the IP addresses between them, have returned return false-negative results for private-ip.

The following tests in the updated test.js indicate that these were incorrectly designated as public IPs:

All of the above IPs can result in SSRF in private-ip v1.0.5.

As this is a server-side package, it is difficult to ascertain the exact magnitude of use, as there are an incalculable number of server-side projects that use private-ip internally.

#### Mitigation

Update private-ip to version 2.0.0.
