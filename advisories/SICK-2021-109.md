### CVE ID
CVE-2021-22929

### CVSS Score
Pending

### Internal ID
SICK-2021-109
        
### Vendor
Brave
        
### Product
Brave Browser

### Product Versions
1.27 and below

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the Brave Browser v1.27 and below allows a local or physical attacker to view the exact timestamps that a user connected to a v2 onion address. A local or physical attacker could read \~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/tor/data/tor.log identify the exact moment a user connected to a new site, easily triangulating the user via a complete log of connection timestamps, which could be easily compared with a server connection log, a compromised Tor end point, or other related Tor attack, affecting the confidentiality & integrity of a user's Tor session.


### Vendor Response
Fixed in Brave 1.28.x https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/9346

### Proofs of Concept


Visit http://wikitoronionlinks.com/ while using Tor Private Browsing on the Brave Browser.

Click on an assortment of .onion v2 URLs.

Inspect `~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/tor/data/tor.log`

ALL v2 domains are logged at full connection time.

This is actually upstream at the TOR project, however they have considered this "not a bug".
