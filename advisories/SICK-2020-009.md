### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the TCL Android Smart TV series by TCL Technology Group Corporation allows an attacker on the adjacent network to arbitrarily browse and download sensitive files over an insecure web server running on port 7989 that lists all files & directories.

An unprivileged remote attacker on the adjacent network, can download most system files, leading to serious critical information disclosure.

For example, if the TV is assigned a local IP address of 10.0.0.2, an attacker can browse the "/proc" Linux file directory simply by visiting http://10.0.0.2:7989/proc in a web browser.

In version 373, an attacker can navigate the entire root file system by simply visiting http://10.0.0.2:7989 in a web browser.

However, in version 295, the root directory in not browsable from root ('/'). Instead, an attacker can directly visit known Android directories & files. Outside of the root directory of the filesystem, every deeper directory is browsable.

Notable directories that contain critically sensitive information, images, downloads, data, or logs include:

```shell
10.0.0.2:7989/proc
10.0.0.2:7989/dev
10.0.0.2:7989/sys
10.0.0.2:7989/init.rc
10.0.0.2:7989/mnt/sdcard/Download
10.0.0.2:7989/mnt/sdcard/DCIM
10.0.0.2:7989/cache
10.0.0.2:7989/root
10.0.0.2:7989/oem
10.0.0.2:7989/tmp
10.0.0.2:7989/userdata
10.0.0.2:7989/vendor
```

#### Mitigation

The following firmware updates do not refer to the Android system updates; updates refer to the vendor specific third-party firmware updates provided by TCL.

- Update to the latest over-the-air (OTA) vendor firmware from TCL.

Or

- Update to the latest vendor firmware from the TCL website using a USB drive and the firmware update method for your model.

_TCL Android Smart TV's cannot be manually patched without root user access (rooted)._

TCL Smart TV's that are not rooted cannot be manually updated other than using OTA or USB update methods.

Offline TV's are low risk because there are no attackers on the adjacent network.

If your TV is in a high-risk environment, and you are unable to update the vendor firmware, it is recommended to disable internet access on the TCL Android TV until patched.
