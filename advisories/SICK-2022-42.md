### Title
CVE-2022-28345 - Signal client for iOS version 5.33.2 and below are vulnerable to RTLO Injection URI Spoofing using malicious URLs such as gepj.net/selif#/moc.elpmaxe which would appear as example.com/#files/ten.jpeg

### CVE ID
CVE-2022-28345

### CVSS Score
7.5

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

### Internal IDs
SICK-2022-42

### Vendor
Signal

### Product
Signal iOS Client

### Product Versions
5.33.2 and below

### Vulnerability Details

An additional RTLO Injection URI Spoofing in the Signal client for iOS version 5.33.2 and below incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs beginning with a non-breaking space, and a hash character in the URL. This technique allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to send 100% authentic looking links, appearing as any website URL by abusing the non-http & non-https automatic rendering of URLs on the iOS client application for top level domains. An attacker can spoof, for example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious destination. An attacker only requires a subdomain such as: gepj, txt, fdp, or xcod, which would appear as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx respectively. This only affects iOS but can be sent via any other client.

### Vendor Response
Fixed in Signal iOS client 5.34 released around April 7-8th 2022 depending on your App Store.

Patch: [https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/commit/b0721e601e549996154127225c68769dfbfae506](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/commit/b0721e601e549996154127225c68769dfbfae506)


### Proof of Concept

Send a message to someone, using natural looking domains, such as apple.com, imgur.com, dhl.com, etc.

`gepj.net/selif#/moc.rugmi`

Will appear as

`imgur.com/#files/ten.jpeg`

The use of the `#` character, and removal of `http`/`https` causes the Signal client to hyperlink the entire URL and bypasses previous related CVE's.

import sys

_LEGWEB = 'imgur.com'

_ATTWEB = 'gepj.net'

_SUBDIR = 'images'

_RTLO = (u'\u202e')

_LEGWEB = _LEGWEB[::-1]
_SUBDIR = _SUBDIR[::-1]

print(_LEGWEB+'/'+_SUBDIR)

_ATTFULL = _LEGWEB+'/'+_SUBDIR

print(_ATTFULL)

sys.stdout.write(' ' + _RTLO + (_ATTWEB + '/' + _SUBDIR + '#/' + _LEGWEB) +'\n')

```

This is due to the following RTLO character, and the abuse of trusted TLD domains:

`<0x202e>gepj.net/segami#/moc.rugmi`
