### Title
python stdlib "ipaddress" - Improper Input Validation of octal literals in python 3.8.0 thru v3.10 results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities. -- "ipaddress leading zeros in IPv4 address"

### CVE ID
CVE-2021-29921

### CVSS Score
Pending

### Internal ID
SICK-2021-014
        
### Vendor
python
        
### Product
ipaddress stdlib    

### Product Versions
3.8.0 thru v3.10

### Vulnerability Details

Improper input validation of octal strings in Python 3.8.0 thru v3.10 stdlib ipaddress allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on Python stdlib ipaddress. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid IP addresses. For example, an attacker submitting an IP address to a web application that relies on stdlib ipaddress, could cause SSRF via inputting octal input data; An attacker can submit exploitable IP addresses if the octet is 3 digits, with the minimum exploitable octect being 08 (Denial of Service) and the maximum exploitable octet is 099. For example, an attacker can submit 010.8.8.8, which is 8.8.8.8, yet Python ipaddress builtin will evaluate this as 10.8.8.8.


### Vendor Response
Currently unpatched - due to be addressed in next release.

*Stop rejecting IPv4 octets for being ambiguously octal. Leading zeros are ignored, and no longer are assumed to specify octal octets. Octets are always decimal numbers. Octets must still be no more than three digits, including leading zeroes.*
